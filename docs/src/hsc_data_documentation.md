# HSC Database Documentation

## 1 Model setup parameters

Model settings parameters are specified in a `hsc_Settings.yml` file which should be located in the current working directory (or to specify an alternative location, edit the `settings_path` variable in your `Run.jl` file). Settings include those related to model structure, solution strategy and outputs, policy constraints, and others. Model structure related settings parameter affects the formulation of the model constraint and objective functions. Computational performance related parameters affect the accuracy of the solution. Policy related parameters specify the policy type and policy goal. Network related parameters specify settings related to transmission network expansion and losses. Note that all settings parameters are case sensitive.

- H2TruckNumber: recording the number of different truck states of full and empty according to types
- H2TruckState: recording the different truck states of available full and available empty and charged or discharged at each zone

##### 3.2.7.1 H2 Truck Capacity

This file reports truck capacity and related compression capacity. The columns are separated by different truck types and ended with a total column recording total capacity over different types of trucks.

##### 3.2.7.2 H2TruckTransit Folder
This folder contains output files reporting variables of different transition statuses (arrive, depart and travel) in combination with loading statuses (full and empty). Each file is named after the pattern like H2Truck{transition}{loading}.csv like H2TruckArriveFull.csv reports total number of arriving trucks. The columns are separated by truck types and indexed with time steps. Other files have the same logic of reporting outputs.

##### 3.2.7.3 H2TruckFlow Folder
This folder contains output files reporting variables of hydrogen flow through different types of trucks. Each file is named after the pattern like H2TruckFlow_{type}.csv like H2TruckFlow_Gas.csv. H2TruckFlow_Gas.csv reports hydrogen flow through different types of hydrogen trucks. The columns are separated by zones and indexed with time steps. Other files have the same logic of reporting outputs.

##### 3.2.7.4 H2TruckNumber Folder
This folder contains output files reporting variables of total hydrogen truck number in different loading statuses. Each file is named after the pattern like H2TruckNumber{loading}.csv like H2TruckNumberFull.csv. The columns are separated by different truck types and indexed with time steps. Other files have the same logic of reporting outputs.

##### 3.2.7.5 H2TruckState Folder
This folder contains output files reporting variables of total hydrogen truck state in different statuses. Each file is named after the pattern like H2Truck{state}.csv. Candidate states are in *AvailEmpty*, *AvailFull*, *Charged* and *Discharged*. The columns are separated by combination of zones and different truck types and indexed with time steps. Other files have the same logic of reporting outputs.
