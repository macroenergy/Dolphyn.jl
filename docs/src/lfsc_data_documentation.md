# LFSC Database Documentation

## 1 Model setup parameters

Model settings parameters are specified in a `lfsc_Settings.yml` file which should be located in the current working directory (or to specify an alternative location, edit the `settings_path` variable in your `Run.jl` file). Settings include those related to model structure, solution strategy and outputs, policy constraints, and others. Model structure related settings parameter affects the formulation of the model constraint and objective functions. Computational performance related parameters affect the accuracy of the solution. Policy related parameters specify the policy type and policy goal. Note that all settings parameters are case sensitive.

## 2 Inputs

All input files are in CSV format. Running the GenX submodule requires a minimum of five input files. Additionally, the user may need to specify five more input files based on model configuration and type of scenarios of interest. Names of the input files and their functionality is given below. Note that names of the input files are case sensitive.

### 2.1 Mandatory input data
#### 2.1.1 Liquid\_Fuels\_Diesel\_Demand.csv

This file includes parameters to characterize model the diesel demand for each time step for each zone, the cost of conventional diesel, emission factor for conventional and synthetic diesel. Note that DOLPHYN is designed to model hourly time steps. With some care and effort, finer (e.g. 15 minute) or courser (e.g. 2 hour) time steps can be modeled so long as all time-related parameters are scaled appropriately (e.g. time period weights, heat rates, ramp rates and minimum up and down times for generators, variable costs, etc).

## 3 Outputs

The table below summarizes the output variables reported as part of the various CSV files produced after each model run. The reported units are also provided. When the model is run with time domain reduction, if a result file includes time-dependent values (e.g. for each model time step), the value will not include the hour weight in it. An annual sum ("AnnualSum") column/row will be provided whenever it is possible (e.g., `LF_Diesel_Balance.csv`), and this value takes the time-weights into account.
