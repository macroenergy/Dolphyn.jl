    write_h2_elec_costs(path::AbstractString, sep::AbstractString, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict, EP::Model)

Function for reporting electricity costs associated with hydrogen production, based on marginal electricity prices during time of generation. If GenX is configured as a mixed integer linear program, then this output is only generated if `WriteShadowPrices` flag is activated. If configured as a linear program (i.e. linearized unit commitment or economic dispatch) then output automatically available.
