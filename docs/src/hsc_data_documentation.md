# HSC Database Documentation

## 1 Model setup parameters

Model settings parameters are specified in a `hsc_Settings.yml` file which should be located in the current working directory (or to specify an alternative location, edit the `settings_path` variable in your `Run.jl` file). Settings include those related to model structure, solution strategy and outputs, policy constraints, and others. Model structure related settings parameter affects the formulation of the model constraint and objective functions. Computational performance related parameters affect the accuracy of the solution. Policy related parameters specify the policy type and policy goal. Network related parameters specify settings related to transmission network expansion and losses. Note that all settings parameters are case sensitive.

### 2.2 Optional input data

#### 2.2.1 HSC\_CO2\_cap.csv

This file contains inputs specifying CO2 emission limits policies (e.g. emissions cap and permit trading programs). This file is needed if `H2CO2Cap` flag is activated in the YAML file `hsc_settings.yml`. `h2CO2Cap` flag set to 1 represents mass-based (tonnes CO2 ) emission target. `CO2Cap` flag set to 2 is specified when emission target is given in terms of rate (tonnes-CO2/MWh-H$_2$) and is based on total demand met. `H2CO2Cap` flag set to 3 is specified when emission target is given in terms of rate (tonnes-CO2 /MWh-H$_2$) and is based on total generation.

Note that there is a global setting available to set one CO2 constraint across both the power and hydrogen sectors. This uses the CO2_cap.csv inputs, so the limits in this file can be set to zero.
