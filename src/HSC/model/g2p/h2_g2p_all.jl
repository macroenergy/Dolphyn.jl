    h2_g2p_all(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)

The hydrogen to power module creates decision variables, expressions, and constraints related to hydrogen generation infrastructure

The variable defined in this file named after ```vH2G2P``` covers .

**Constraints on generation discharge capacity**

One cannot retire more capacity than existing capacity.
```math
\begin{equation*}
    0 \leq y_{g, z}^{\textrm{\textrm{H,G2P,retired}} \leq y_{g, z}^{\textrm{\textrm{H,G2P,existing}} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}, z \in \mathcal{Z}
\end{equation*}
```

For resources where upper bound $\overline{y_{g}^{\textrm{\textrm{H,G2P}}}}$ and lower bound $\underline{y_{g}^{\textrm{\textrm{H,G2P}}}}$ of capacity is defined, then we impose constraints on minimum and maximum power capacity.

```math
\begin{equation*}
    \underline{y}_{g, z}^{\textrm{\textrm{H,G2P}}} \leq y_{g, z}^{\textrm{\textrm{H,G2P}} \leq \overline{y}_{g, z}^{\textrm{\textrm{H,G2P}} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}, z \in \mathcal{Z}
\end{equation*}
